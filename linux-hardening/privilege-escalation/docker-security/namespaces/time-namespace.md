## Basic Information

The time namespace allows for per-namespace offsets to the system monotonic and boot-time clocks. The time namespace is suited for Linux containers usage for allowing the date/time to be changed within a container and for adjusting clocks within a container following restoration from a checkpoint/snapshot.

## Lab:

### Create different Namespaces

#### CLI

```bash
sudo unshare -T [--mount-proc] /bin/bash
```

By mounting a new instance of the `/proc` filesystem if you use the param `--mount-proc`, you ensure that the new mount namespace has an **accurate and isolated view of the process information specific to that namespace**.

<summary>Error: bash: fork: Cannot allocate memory</summary>

When `unshare` is executed without the `-f` option, an error is encountered due to the way Linux handles new PID (Process ID) namespaces. The key details and the solution are outlined below:

1. **Problem Explanation**:
    - The Linux kernel allows a process to create new namespaces using the `unshare` system call. However, the process that initiates the creation of a new PID namespace (referred to as the "unshare" process) does not enter the new namespace; only its child processes do.
    - Running `%unshare -p /bin/bash%` starts `/bin/bash` in the same process as `unshare`. Consequently, `/bin/bash` and its child processes are in the original PID namespace.
    - The first child process of `/bin/bash` in the new namespace becomes PID 1. When this process exits, it triggers the cleanup of the namespace if there are no other processes, as PID 1 has the special role of adopting orphan processes. The Linux kernel will then disable PID allocation in that namespace.

2. **Consequence**:
    - The exit of PID 1 in a new namespace leads to the cleaning of the `PIDNS_HASH_ADDING` flag. This results in the `alloc_pid` function failing to allocate a new PID when creating a new process, producing the "Cannot allocate memory" error.

3. **Solution**:
    - The issue can be resolved by using the `-f` option with `unshare`. This option makes `unshare` fork a new process after creating the new PID namespace.
    - Executing `%unshare -fp /bin/bash%` ensures that the `unshare` command itself becomes PID 1 in the new namespace. `/bin/bash` and its child processes are then safely contained within this new namespace, preventing the premature exit of PID 1 and allowing normal PID allocation.

By ensuring that `unshare` runs with the `-f` flag, the new PID namespace is correctly maintained, allowing `/bin/bash` and its sub-processes to operate without encountering the memory allocation error.

#### Docker

```bash
docker run -ti --name ubuntu1 -v /usr:/ubuntu1 ubuntu bash
```

### &#x20;Check which namespace is your process in

```bash
ls -l /proc/self/ns/time
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 0 Apr  4 21:16 /proc/self/ns/time -> 'time:[4026531834]'
```

### Find all Time namespaces

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```bash
sudo find /proc -maxdepth 3 -type l -name time -exec readlink {} \; 2>/dev/null | sort -u
# Find the processes with an specific namespace
sudo find /proc -maxdepth 3 -type l -name time -exec ls -l  {} \; 2>/dev/null | grep <ns-number>
```
{% endcode %}

### Enter inside a Time namespace

```bash
nsenter -T TARGET_PID --pid /bin/bash
```

Also, you can only **enter in another process namespace if you are root**. And you **cannot** **enter** in other namespace **without a descriptor** pointing to it (like `/proc/self/ns/net`).
